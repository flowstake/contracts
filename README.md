# Creating a Self-Staking Solidity Smart Contract

Creating a self-staking Solidity smart contract connected to the data output of a completed Strava activity with the title "Proof of Activity as a Stake" and including P2P attestation with a photo of the activity involves several components. The contract needs to handle data input from Strava, verify the proof of activity, and manage staking logic. This example will focus on the core functionalities:

## Core Functionalities

### Tracking Activity Completion
The contract will store the proof of activity from Strava.

### P2P Attestation
Users can attest to the activity by submitting photos.

### Staking Logic
Users can stake tokens based on their activities.

Here's a simplified version of such a contract:
